# Gif-Tastic

When a user clicks on a button 10 Gif images from that button should appear
When the user clicks on the image the Gif should be still
When the user clicks on the image again the Gif should animate
Every Image(Gif) shown should have a rating such as PG or G.
You then should add a Form to the page to select new Gifs to display on the page.
